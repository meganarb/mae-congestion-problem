<h1>M.A.E Congestion Problem<h1>
<p>Our collective action problem focuses on traffic congestion where the limited resource is road space and one can choose a car or bus. Below are our different stages of our project presentations.<p>

## How To Run
Temp, update this before submitting!

## Project Scenario
### When students travel to campus they have the option to take a car or bus. Depending on their decision, it can contribute to road congestion because of the limit road space available. In our game, these are the contraints: 
* N players
* 2 strategies: car or bus
* Limited amount of road space
* Set number of buses
* Players can switch strategy depending on delay.

## Mechanism
* Current: we are using the repetition mechanism
* It simulates days as rounds 
* We make it a possibility for players to switch strategy depending on the level of congestion on the road (delay function is high)

## Delay Function
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77eb0717-681c-474e-83ae-e2555e13cb79)
* Di(car) – delay when the player takes a car
* Di(bus) – delay when the player takes the bus
* Sc – size of car 
* Sb – space taken by busses
* C – number of cars (other than the player)
* R – available road space 
* B – delay caused by taking bus

## Nash and Pareto
